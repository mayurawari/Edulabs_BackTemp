Assignment: Task Management System with Secure
Authentication

Problem Statement:

Create a backend API for a task management system with enhanced security and
user role management.

Requirements:

1. API Endpoints:
User registration and JWT-based authentication with role-based access
control (e.g., admin, user).
CRUD operations for tasks, with permissions based on user roles.
Retrieve and filter tasks based on priority, status, and assigned user.

2. Database Interaction:
Use TypeORM or Drizzle to manage users, roles, and tasks, with enforced
data integrity.

3. Dependency Injection:
Implement DI for authentication services, role management, and task
handling.

4. Security:
Implement route guards and middleware for role-based access control and
input validation.

5. Code Quality:
Follow best practices, use appropriate design patterns
